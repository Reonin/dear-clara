          My Dearest Clara,
  <br>
&emsp;  It has been eight fortnight but feels like eight score since I last laid eyes upon your visage. Another day that I still remain here in the land of the free and living. They say the Covid has ravaged the greater part of our state but the war may soon be over. I have done my part to help in the battle. I kept my supplies fully stocked in case of hardship. There are many out there on the front lines in hospitals caring for the afflicted but also many out there on lesser known battles - to those folk delivering goods to those of us in our trenches. I have made the most of my time in quarantine productive by practicing indoor athletics and cooking my rations over an open flame.
  <br>
  &emsp;It leaves me quite inspired to hear you diving into your studies. We are not all fortunate enough to turn these lemons into lemonade but my dear it seems you have gone a step further and made an Arnold Palmer. I only hope you get a chance to partake of the efforts by the time summer rolls around. I too shall begin some coursework to further advance my knowledge, time is on my side and I hope to prevail soon before the wild winds of the outdoors beckon me out once more.

    <br>
    &emsp;I’m lucky to have the opportunity to help my fellow soldiers make it through the war. I’m not blessed with the ability to heal or to provide anything essential in nature but my labor provides an outlet that gives respite to the weary. Feel free to continue utilizing my moving picture pass, I trust you have already put it to better use than I have in these dire times. My fellow infantrymen and I talked at great lengths about a man who was “King of Tigers”. Such a comical notion and if you have the opportunity to I would recommend you see this in the theater.
    <br>
  &emsp;  To the bottom of my heart, I hope you and your family are in good health and good spirits. I look forward to the day when we can reunite and cachinnate over pleasantries and puns.
    <br><br>
  Corey Anthony Jeffers
